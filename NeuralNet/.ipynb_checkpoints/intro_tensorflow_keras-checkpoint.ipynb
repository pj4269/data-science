    "Before showing steps of installation, it is important to make note of the computation units on your machine that TensorFlow would use. You have two options to run your TensorFlow code: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use the CPU or \n",
    "2. You can use the GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since GPU's are more suitable to run linear matrix operations faster than the CPUs, data scientists prefer to use them when available. Although training deep learning models on GPUs are way faster than training them on CPUs, accessing GPUs might be costly. The easiest solution for training your models on a GPU is using Google Colaboratory which offers free GPUs. That being said, the TensorFlow codes we'll write will be the same regardless of the underlying computational unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the installation of the TensorFlow. In doing so, we make use of the pip package manager of Python. If you'd like to install CPU version of the TensorFlow, then just run this on your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-rc1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you'd like to use GPU version of the TensorFlow, you should run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-rc1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

We import it in our code as the following:\n",

For example, the second layer comes after the first layer, the third layer comes after the second layer etc. Keras mimics this sequential structure of the deep learning model when implementing them programmatically.\n",

Using this dataset in deep learning research and education is classical and that's why we choose it here. In the following, we'll load the dataset and do some data preprocessing. As we'll see shortly, each image is represented as 28x28 pixel data. This is a two-dimensional vector. We'll first convert this to a vector of 784 length which will be single-dimensional. We also normalize each vector by dividing each element by 255 (this is the maximum value of the RGB color scale). \n",
