    "*  **Parallel**: Dask can use all of the cores on the computer it runs on. Even more, it can scale to multiple machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Larger-than-memory**: NumPy arrays can only work with data that fits into the memory. Dask arrays let us work on datasets that are larger than the available memory by breaking up the arrays into many smaller pieces called **chunks**. This is illustrated in the figure below:\n",

    "<img src=\"assets/array.png\" width=\"25%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Blocked Algorithms**: Blocked algorithms are the algorithms that perform a large computation by dividing it into smaller computations and then aggregating the results. Hence, when implementing a blocked algorithm using Dask arrays instead of NumPy arrays, we can take advantage of the parallelization. \n",

    "We'll start using Dask arrays with generating random values. But before that, we start a Dask client. Remember that starting a client isn't necessary when working with Dask on our local computer but still it provides us a dashboard where we can investigate our computations. We'll again configure our client to have as four workers and 2 thread in each worker. We also set 2GB memory limit to each worker."
